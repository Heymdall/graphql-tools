description: Implementing and using custom `@directive`s that transform schema types, fields, and arguments
---

A _directive_ is an identifier preceded by a `@` character, optionally followed by a list of named arguments, which can appear after almost any form of syntax in the GraphQL query or schema languages. Here's an example from the [GraphQL draft specification](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec-Type-System.Directives) that illustrates several of these possibilities:

```typescript
directive @deprecated(
  reason: String = "No longer supported"
) on FIELD_DEFINITION | ENUM_VALUE

type ExampleType {
  newField: String
  oldField: String @deprecated(reason: "Use `newField`.")
}
```

Points to notice in this example:

* The `@deprecated` directive _follows_ the field that it pertains to (`oldField`), even though its syntax might remind you of "decorators" in other languages, which usually appear on the line above.
* Directives are often _declared_ in the schema, as in this example, though it's up to the GraphQL server to enforce the argument types (`reason: String`) and locations (`FIELD_DEFINITION | ENUM_VALUE`) of the declaration.
* The `@deprecated(reason: ...)` syntax is legal even without the `directive @deprecated ...` declaration.
* Whether a directive has been declared or not, the GraphQL server is responsible for giving it meaning, or else it will be ignored after parsing, almost as if it was a comment.

While only a few directives are [required](http://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/#sec--skip) by the specification, the formal syntax of the GraphQL query and schema languages allows arbitrary user-defined directives to appear as modifiers following almost any kind of type, field, or argument. If the server knows how to interpret them, these directive annotations can be a powerful tool for preventing repetition, specifying extra behavior, enforcing additional type or value restrictions, and enabling static analysis.

This document focuses on directives that appear in GraphQL _schemas_ (as opposed to queries) written in [Schema Definition Language](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/pull/90), or SDL for short. Specifically, the following sections will explain how custom directives can be implemented and used to modify the structure and behavior of a GraphQL schema in ways that would not be possible using SDL syntax alone.

The possible applications of directive syntax are numerous: enforcing access permissions, formatting date strings, auto-generating resolver functions for a particular backend API, marking strings for internationalization, synthesizing globally unique object identifiers, specifying caching behavior, skipping or including or deprecating fields, and just about anything else you can imagine.

## Implementing schema directives

Since the GraphQL specification does not discuss any specific implementation strategy for directives, it's up to each GraphQL server framework to expose an API for implementing new directives.

If you're using Apollo Server, you are also likely to be using the [`graphql-tools`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools) npm package, which provides a convenient yet powerful tool for implementing directive syntax: the [`SchemaDirectiveVisitor`](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools/blob/wip-schema-directives/src/schemaVisitor.ts) class.

To implement a schema directive using `SchemaDirectiveVisitor`, simply create a subclass of `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` that overrides one or more of the following visitor methods:

* `visitSchema(schema: GraphQLSchema)`
* `visitScalar(scalar: GraphQLScalarType)`
* `visitObject(object: GraphQLObjectType)`
* `visitFieldDefinition(field: GraphQLField<any, any>)`
* `visitArgumentDefinition(argument: GraphQLArgument)`
* `visitInterface(iface: GraphQLInterfaceType)`
* `visitUnion(union: GraphQLUnionType)`
* `visitEnum(type: GraphQLEnumType)`
* `visitEnumValue(value: GraphQLEnumValue)`
* `visitInputObject(object: GraphQLInputObjectType)`
* `visitInputFieldDefinition(field: GraphQLInputField)`

By overriding methods like `visitObject`, a subclass of `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` expresses interest in certain schema types such as `GraphQLObjectType` (the first parameter type of `visitObject`).

When `SchemaDirectiveVisitor.visitSchemaDirectives` is called with a `GraphQLSchema` object and a map of visitor subclasses (`{ [directiveName: string]: typeof SchemaDirectiveVisitor }`), visitor methods overridden by those subclasses will be invoked with references to any schema objects that have appropriately named directives attached to them, enabling the visitors to inspect or modify the schema.

For example, here is one possible implementation of the `@deprecated` directive we saw above:

```typescript
import { SchemaDirectiveVisitor } from "graphql-tools";

class DeprecatedDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  public visitFieldDefinition(field: GraphQLField<any, any>) {
    value.isDeprecated = true;
    value.deprecationReason = this.args.reason;
  }

  public visitEnumValue(value: GraphQLEnumValue) {
    value.isDeprecated = true;
    value.deprecationReason = this.args.reason;
  }
}
```

In order to apply this implementation to a schema that contains `@deprecated` directives, simply pass the `DeprecatedDirective` class to the `makeExecutableSchema` function via the `directives` option:

```typescript
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "graphql-tools";

const typeDefs = `
type ExampleType {
  newField: String
  oldField: String @deprecated(reason: "Use \`newField\`.")
}`;

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  directives: {
    deprecated: DeprecatedDirective
  }
});
```

Alternatively, if you want to modify an existing schema object, you can use the `SchemaDirectiveVisitor.visitSchemaDirectives` interface directly:

```typescript
SchemaDirectiveVisitor.visitSchemaDirectives(schema, {
  deprecated: DeprecatedDirective
});
```

Note that a subclass of `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` may be instantiated multiple times to visit multiple different occurrences of the `@deprecated` directive. That's why you provide a class rather than an instance of that class.

If for some reason you have a schema that uses another name for the `@deprecated` directive, that's not a problem. The same `DeprecatedDirective` class can be used with a different name, simply by changing its key in the `directives` object passed to `makeExecutableSchema`. In other words, `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` implementations are effectively anonymous, so it's up to whoever uses them to assign names to them.

## Examples

To appreciate the range of possibilities enabled by `SchemaDirectiveVisitor`, let's examine a variety of practical examples.

> Note that these examples are written in JavaScript rather than TypeScript, though either language should work.

### Uppercasing strings

Suppose you want to ensure a string-valued field is converted to uppercase:

```javascript
import { defaultFieldResolver } from "graphql";

const typeDefs = `
directive @upper on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
  hello: String @upper
}`;

class UpperCaseDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitFieldDefinition(field) {
    const { resolve = defaultFieldResolver } = field;
    field.resolve = async function (...args) {
      const result = await resolve.apply(this, args);
      if (typeof result === "string") {
        return result.toUpperCase();
      }
      return result;
    };
  }
}

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  directives: {
    upper: UpperCaseDirective,
    upperCase: UpperCaseDirective
  }
});
```

### Fetching data from a REST API

Suppose you've defined an object type that corresponds to a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) resource, and you want to avoid implementing resolver functions for every field:

```javascript
const typeDefs = `
directive @rest(url: String) on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
  people: [Person] @rest(url: "/api/v1/people")
}`;

class RestDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  public visitFieldDefinition(field) {
    const { url } = this.args;
    field.resolve = () => fetch(url);
  }
}

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  directives: {
    rest: RestDirective
  }
});
```

There are many more issues to consider when implementing a real GraphQL wrapper over a REST endpoint (such as how to do caching or pagination), but this example demonstrates the basic structure.

### Formatting date strings

Suppose your resolver returns a `Date` object but you want to return a formatted string to the client:

```javascript
const typeDefs = `
directive @date(format: String) on FIELD_DEFINITION

scalar Date

type Post {
  published: Date @date(format: "mmmm d, yyyy")
}`;

class DateFormatDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitFieldDefinition(field) {
    const { resolve = defaultFieldResolver } = field;
    const { format } = this.args;
    field.resolve = async function (...args) {
      const date = await resolve.apply(this, args);
      return require('dateformat')(date, format);
    };
    // The formatted Date becomes a String, so the field type must change:
    field.type = GraphQLString;
  }
}

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  directives: {
    date: DateFormatDirective
  }
});
```

### Marking strings for internationalization

```typescript
const typeDefs = `
directive @intl on FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
  greeting: String @intl
}`;

class IntlDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitFieldDefinition(field, details) {
    const { resolve = defaultFieldResolver } = field;
    field.resolve = async function (...args) {
      const context = args[2];
      const defaultText = await resolve.apply(this, args);
      // In this example, path would be ["Query", "greeting"]:
      const path = [details.objectType.name, field.name];
      return translate(defaultText, path, context.locale);
    };
  }
}

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  directives: {
    intl: IntlDirective
  }
});
```

### Enforcing access permissions

To implement the `@auth` example mentioned in the [**Declaring schema directives** section](schema-directives.md#declaring-schema-directives) below:

```typescript
const typeDefs = `
directive @auth(
  requires: Role = ADMIN,
) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION

enum Role {
  ADMIN
  REVIEWER
  USER
  UNKNOWN
}

type User @auth(requires: USER) {
  name: String
  banned: Boolean @auth(requires: ADMIN)
  canPost: Boolean @auth(requires: REVIEWER)
}`;

// Symbols can be a good way to store semi-hidden data on schema objects.
const authRoleSymbol = Symbol.for("@auth role");
const authWrapSymbol = Symbol.for("@auth wrapped");

class AuthDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitObject(type) {
    this.ensureFieldsWrapped(type);
    type[authRoleSymbol] = this.args.requires;
  }

  visitFieldDefinition(field, details) {
    this.ensureFieldsWrapped(details.objectType);
    field[authRoleSymbol] = this.args.requires;
  }

  ensureFieldsWrapped(type) {
    // Mark the GraphQLObjectType object to avoid re-wrapping its fields:
    if (type[authWrapSymbol]) {
      return;
    }

    const fields = type.getFields();
    Object.keys(fields).forEach(fieldName => {
      const field = fields[fieldName];
      const { resolve = defaultFieldResolver } = field;
      field.resolve = async function (...args) {
        // Get the required role from the field first, falling back to the
        // parent GraphQLObjectType if no role is required by the field:
        const requiredRole = field[authRoleSymbol] || type[authRoleSymbol];
        if (! requiredRole) {
          return resolve.apply(this, args);
        }
        const context = args[2];
        const user = await getUser(context.headers.authToken);
        if (! user.hasRole(requiredRole)) {
          throw new Error("not authorized");
        }
        return resolve.apply(this, args);
      };
    });

    type[authWrapSymbol] = true;
  }
};

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  directives: {
    auth: AuthDirective,
    authorized: AuthDirective,
    authenticated: AuthDirective
  }
});
```

### Enforcing value restrictions

Suppose you want to enforce a maximum length for a string-valued field:

```typescript
const typeDefs = `
directive @length(max: Int) on FIELD_DEFINITION | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION

type Query {
  books: [Book]
}

type Book {
  title: String @length(max: 50)
}

type Mutation {
  createBook(book: BookInput): Book
}

input BookInput {
  title: String! @length(max: 50)
}`;

class LimitedLengthType extends GraphQLScalarType {
  constructor(type, maxLength) {
    super({
      name: `LengthAtMost${maxLength}`,

      // For more information about GraphQLScalar type (de)serialization,
      // see the graphql-js implementation:
      // https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/31ae8a8e8312/src/type/definition.js#L425-L446

      serialize(value) {
        value = type.serialize(value);
        assert.isAtMost(value.length, maxLength);
        return value;
      }

      parseValue(value) {
        return type.parseValue(value);
      },

      parseLiteral(ast) {
        return type.parseLiteral(ast);
      }
    });
  }
}

class LengthDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitInputFieldDefinition(field) {
    this.wrapType(field);
  }

  visitFieldDefinition(field) {
    this.wrapType(field);
  }

  wrapType(field) {
    if (field.type instanceof GraphQLNonNull &&
        field.type.ofType instanceof GraphQLScalarType) {
      field.type = new GraphQLNonNull(
        new LimitedLengthType(field.type.ofType, this.args.max));
    } else if (field.type instanceof GraphQLScalarType) {
      field.type = new LimitedLengthType(field.type, this.args.max);
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Not a scalar type: ${field.type}`);
    }
  }
}

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  directives: {
    length: LengthDirective
  }
});
```

### Synthesizing unique IDs

Suppose your database uses incrementing IDs for each resource type, so IDs are not unique across all resource types. Here's how you might synthesize a field called `uid` that combines the object type with the non-unique ID to produce an ID that's unique across your schema:

```typescript
const typeDefs = `
declare @uniqueID(
  name: String!
  from: [String!] = ["id"]
) on OBJECT

type Person @uniqueID(name: "uid", from: ["personID"]) {
  personID: Int
  name: String
}

type Location @uniqueID(name: "uid") {
  id: Int
  address: String
}`;

class UniqueIdDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  visitObject(type) {
    const { name, from } = this.args;
    type.getFields()[name] = {
      name: name,
      type: GraphQLID,
      description: 'Unique ID',
      args: [],
      resolve(object) {
        const hash = require("crypto").createHash("sha1");
        hash.update(type.name);
        from.forEach(fieldName => {
          hash.update(String(object[fieldName]));
        });
        return hash.digest("hex");
      }
    };
  }
}

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  directives: {
    uniqueID: UniqueIdDirective
  }
});
```

## Declaring schema directives

While the above examples should be sufficient to implement any `@directive` used in your schema, SDL syntax also supports declaring the names, argument types, default argument values, and permissible locations of any available directives:

```js
directive @auth(
  requires: Role = ADMIN,
) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION

enum Role {
  ADMIN
  REVIEWER
  USER
  UNKNOWN
}

type User @auth(requires: USER) {
  name: String
  banned: Boolean @auth(requires: ADMIN)
  canPost: Boolean @auth(requires: REVIEWER)
}
```

This hypothetical `@auth` directive takes an argument named `requires` of type `Role`, which defaults to `ADMIN` if `@auth` is used without passing an explicit `requires` argument. The `@auth` directive can appear on an `OBJECT` like `User` to set a default access control for all `User` fields, and also on individual fields, to enforce field-specific `@auth` restrictions.

Enforcing the requirements of the declaration is something a `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` implementation could do itself, in theory, but the SDL syntax is easer to read and write, and provides value even if you're not using the `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` abstraction.

However, if you're implementing a reusable `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` for public consumption, you will probably not be the person writing the SDL syntax, so you may not have control over which directives the schema author decides to declare, and how. That's why a well-implemented, reusable `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` should consider overriding the `getDirectiveDeclaration` method:

```typescript
import {
  DirectiveLocation,
  GraphQLDirective,
  GraphQLEnumType,
} from "graphql";

class AuthDirective extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
  public visitObject(object: GraphQLObjectType) {...}
  public visitFieldDefinition(field: GraphQLField<any, any>) {...}

  public static getDirectiveDeclaration(
    directiveName: string,
    schema: GraphQLSchema,
  ): GraphQLDirective {
    const previousDirective = schema.getDirective(directiveName);
    if (previousDirective) {
      // If a previous directive declaration exists in the schema, it may be
      // better to modify it than to return a new GraphQLDirective object.
      previousDirective.args.forEach(arg => {
        if (arg.name === 'requires') {
          // Lower the default minimum Role from ADMIN to REVIEWER.
          arg.defaultValue = 'REVIEWER';
        }
      });

      return previousDirective;
    }

    // If a previous directive with this name was not found in the schema,
    // there are several options:
    //
    // 1. Construct a new GraphQLDirective (see below).
    // 2. Throw an exception to force the client to declare the directive.
    // 3. Return null, and forget about declaring this directive.
    //
    // All three are valid options, since the visitor will still work without
    // any declared directives. In fact, unless you're publishing a directive
    // implementation for public consumption, you can probably just ignore
    // getDirectiveDeclaration altogether.

    return new GraphQLDirective({
      name: directiveName,
      locations: [
        DirectiveLocation.OBJECT,
        DirectiveLocation.FIELD_DEFINITION,
      ],
      args: {
        requires: {
          // Having the schema available here is important for obtaining
          // references to existing type objects, such as the Role enum.
          type: (schema.getType('Role') as GraphQLEnumType),
          // Set the default minimum Role to REVIEWER.
          defaultValue: 'REVIEWER',
        }
      }]
    });
  }
}
```

Since the `getDirectiveDeclaration` method receives not only the name of the directive but also the `GraphQLSchema` object, it can modify and/or reuse previous declarations found in the schema, as an alternative to returning a totally new `GraphQLDirective` object. Either way, if the visitor returns a non-null `GraphQLDirective` from `getDirectiveDeclaration`, that declaration will be used to check arguments and permissible locations.

## What about `directiveResolvers`?

Before `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` was implemented, the `makeExecutableSchema` function took a `directiveResolvers` option that could be used for implementing certain kinds of `@directive`s on fields that have resolver functions.

The new abstraction is more general, since it can visit any kind of schema syntax, and do much more than just wrap resolver functions. However, the old `directiveResolvers` API has been [left in place](directive-resolvers.md) for backwards compatibility, though it is now implemented in terms of `SchemaDirectiveVisitor`:

```typescript
function attachDirectiveResolvers(
  schema: GraphQLSchema,
  directiveResolvers: IDirectiveResolvers<any, any>,
) {
  const directives = Object.create(null);

  Object.keys(directiveResolvers).forEach(directiveName => {
    directives[directiveName] = class extends SchemaDirectiveVisitor {
      public visitFieldDefinition(field: GraphQLField<any, any>) {
        const resolver = directiveResolvers[directiveName];
        const originalResolver = field.resolve || defaultFieldResolver;
        const directiveArgs = this.args;
        field.resolve = (...args: any[]) => {
          const [source, /* original args */, context, info] = args;
          return resolver(
            async () => originalResolver.apply(field, args),
            source,
            directiveArgs,
            context,
            info,
          );
        };
      }
    };
  });

  SchemaDirectiveVisitor.visitSchemaDirectives(
    schema,
    directives,
  );
}
```

Existing code that uses `directiveResolvers` should probably consider migrating to `SchemaDirectiveVisitor` if feasible, though we have no immediate plans to deprecate `directiveResolvers`.
